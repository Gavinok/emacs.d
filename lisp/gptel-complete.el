;;; Commentary:

;; To use: open up any code buffer, move point to where you want code to be
;; completed, call `gptel-complete'.
;;
;; When the cursor is inside a response, more actions are available:
;; - Not happy with the response? Regenerate it with gptel-complete-regenerate (C-c M-RET),
;; - or delete it with gptel-complete-reject (C-c DEL).
;; - Ediff against previous responses with gptel-complete-ediff (C-c =)
;; - Mark the response with gptel-complete-mark (C-c SPC)
;; - Finalize the response with gptel-complete-accept (C-c RET)
